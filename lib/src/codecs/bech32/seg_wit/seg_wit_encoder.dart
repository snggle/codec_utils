/// A utility class for encoding Segregated Witness (SegWit) data
/// into a Bech32-encoded address string.
///
/// This encoder takes a [SegWit] object and converts it into a valid
/// Bech32 address string following BIP 173 and BIP 350 specifications.
///
/// ## Validation steps
///
/// Before encoding, the encoder validates:
/// - The witness version is within the valid range (0â€“16).
/// - The witness program is neither too short nor too long.
/// - The witness program length is compatible with the specified version.
///
/// ## Encoding process
///
/// - Converts the witness program from 8-bit bytes to 5-bit groups (Bech32 data part).
/// - Prefixes the data list with the witness version.
/// - Encodes the final data list together with the human-readable part (HRP)
///   into a Bech32 address string.
